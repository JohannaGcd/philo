# philo
This project is about simulating philosophers who: Sit around a table - Alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping. - Need two forks (shared resources) to eat. Itâ€™s a synchronization problem : the goal is to learn how to coordinate concurrent access to shared resources (using mutexes) while preventing race conditions.
